        Content: `The Sun of the Early morning sky,  
    Shining down on her beautiful skin,  
    Her Innocence radiating.  
    But her authoritative aura still present.  
    
    She shows the strength of a woman,  
    Her silence shouts power.  
    Weakness is never to be found in a dictionary,  
    The serenity in every action.  
    
    She is indeed strong,  
    Bold and beautiful,  
    Fierce but kindhearted,  
    Never to be found lacking.`,

        Title: "POWER",
        Content: `Running as far as I can,  
    The power of darkness is really strong,  
    I can't drown in this pain.  
    I can't let this darkness engulf me.  
    
    I can see a ray of light,  
    Turning towards that route,  
    I smile, but my smile fades away,  
    These obstacles are too much to handle.  
    
    I close my eyes and open them again,  
    The strength swerves through my veins,  
    My power is restored,  
    With only one thing in mind,
    Finsh this!`,

        Title: "ENSLAVED QUEEN",
        Content: ` A queen of pain, 
        A queen of misery,
        A queen of anguish,
        And an epitome of sadness.
    
    Imprisoned by her own sorrows,
    Caged in her own sufferings,
    Drowning in her own tears,
    Struggling with her own fears.
    
    The dreams lied every time,
    Because her reality seems dark,
    It clearly spells out sadness,
    Its ruler now weakness.
    
    But she knows,
    She has to live to believe,
    That she needs to love to be loved,
    And she hopes that this pain won't be the death of her.`,

        Title: "FALL OF BLISS",
        Content: `Caught unaware I fell,
        The wind of love blew so quickly,
        And then I fell,
        Into the most pleasant horizon.
        
        Falling wasn't the easiest,
        For it got harder with every fall,
        Getting up wasn't an option,
        For I had fallen very deep.
        
        It didn't matter anymore,
        It didn't matter how it ended,
        But still curious to know the end,
        I continued to fall.
        
        I had a hope instilled in me,
        it was not to be broken,
        For I believed,
        That the ecstasy would remain.`,

        Content: `How inviting was your aura,
        Stepping out of my comfort zone,
        I went closer to you,
        And I smiled.
        
        Our frienship bloomed,
        Like a flower would in autumn,
        We fought eat hurdle together,
        Trying to get to our forever.
        
        Sometimes we fought each other,
        It was like a fiery furnance,
        But we quenched that fire,
        We overcame it and moved on.
        
        Earning a place in my heart,
        You vowed to stay,
        Even if its not forever,
        You'll stay till whenever.`,
